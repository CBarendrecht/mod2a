\label{sec:meanhappy}
As it is shown in the section \ref{sec:equi}, equilibrium is not always reached within 10000 generations, stronger even, equilibrium is occasionally never reached at all.
But when it does, it is natural to question whether every individual is happy and how happy they are. 
To answer this question, we ran 500 simulations for each HR ranging from 0 to 1 with increments of $0.01$ and we calculated what the average, maximal and minimal happiness of the population is for each happiness rule. 
We ran the simulations om the standard board and the results are shown in figure \ref{happyhappy}.\\

From figure \ref{happyhappy}, we observe that the minimal happiness is almost always equal to or greater than the happiness rule, which means that every individual is in fact happy  in the equilibrium. 
We also see that maximal happiness is always 1, which means there is always at least one invididual who lives homogenous. 
Furthermore, we see that the average happiness is always closer to the maximal happiness than to the minimal happiness. At a HR of approximately $0.8$, we see that every individual has happiness 1. 
This implies that happiness $0.8$ guarantees nearly full segregation. Complete segregation can only be assured at a HR greater than $87.5$, Namely, assume a person is not homogenous, then at least 1 out of at most 8 neighbours does not share his/her type. In other words, the happiness of this person is at most equal to \(1-\frac{1}{8}=87.5\%\).\\

It is not very surprising that every individual is happy after the equilibrium, since it would otherwise mean that one individual is unable to find a place that better meets his/her desire. 
On a board with $24$ empty spaces, this is rather unlikely. 
Another remarkable result is that figure \ref{happyhappy} shows that the minimal happiness is higher than the HR and that the average happiness is nearly 1 if the happiness rule higher than $0.8$. 
At the first glance this might seems impossible because the heavy requirement of being happy, but on the other hand, it shows that the strong 'need' for segregation actually leads to greater happiness.

To illustrate that the variance of every above calculated average happiness is very low, we  selected Happiness Rule $1/3$ as an example and made a histogram in figure \ref{minhappy}. 
In figure \ref{minhappy}, we see that the probability of every individual is happy is practically $1$.
