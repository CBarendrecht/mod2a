\section{Average number of generations until equilibrium}
There are lots of parameters that may affect the average number of generations until  equilibrium is reached. We chose to look at the influence of the Happiness Rule(HR) on the average generations. For each HR ranging from 0 to 1 with increment 0.01, we ran 500 simulations and calculated the average, maximum and minimum generations it took to reach equilibrium. The results are shown in figure \ref{fig:avegen}.\\
\\
In figure \ref{fig:avegen}, we observe that the average number of generations (blue graph) is increasing with the Happiness Rule, which is to be expected since a higher HR requires more neighbours of the same type, and thus less probability that the selected individual is happy, making it more likely that she will move. We also note that at around a HR of 0.7, the average number of generations becomes more or less constant. This can be explained noting that the requirement for the neighbours will practically be the same. For example, with a happiness of 0.8, a person with 3, 5 or 8 neighbours would require respectively 3, 5 or at least 7 of the same type. This requirement won't change much if a HR of 0.9 is applied. The same argument explains why the average number of generations is constant at very low HR or if we raise the HR with a sufficient small amount like 0.01.\\

It is also interesting to know how the random variable $Y$, which we denote as the number of generations it takes to reach the equilibrium, is distributed. Since $Y$ depends on the position of each individual, whose position also depends on other individuals, the probability distribution of $Y$ might be complicated. Therefore, we approximated the distribution of $Y$ with a histogram (figure \ref{fig:histogram}) of bin size 1, which is reasonable because $Y$ only takes integer values. Also, to look at the influence of the HR on the distribution of $Y$, we made histograms for HR of 1/4, 1/3, 1/2 and 1.  We believe that the histograms are a good model for the distribution of $Y$, since according to the law of large numbers, the histogram will converge to the actual distribution for large numbers of simulations, and we may consider 10000 as a large number.\\

\end{figure}

From figure \ref{fig:histogram}, we see the distribution of $Y$ is quite similar to the binomial distribution. But we don't think that it is binomially distributed because more simulations do not give a more symmetrical distribution. It is not clear for us yet how it is distributed.\\
\\
Interesting to note though, is that both the mean and the variance increase with the happiness rule. In line with the following section, we see a relatively small mean and relatively often large number of generations.\\
\textbf{Partial explanation.} While not immediately intuitive, the relatively small mean cannot be immediately explained. However we do have an explanation for the relatively high frequency for the large number of generations. If, after a few generations, we do not have equilibrium, moving to a better location gets harder. Further details are provided in the following section. Thus, reaching equilibrium eats relatively much time.
