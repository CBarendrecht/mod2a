\section{The effect of switching types}
\label{section:switch}
Segregation is a phenomenon taking many different forms. Rather than  limiting the scope to racial segregation, we decided to broaden our view. 
For example, one might delve into the segregation in studies with respect to friendship. 
In this case, for any person \(k\). The neighbours of \(k\) represent the \(k\)'s friends or the persons with whom \(k\) spends most of his time.
In this case, \(k\)'s type, can represent either the classes he is currently taking, or the kind of sports person \(k\) is doing, or more likely, \(k\)'s political beliefs.
In any of these cases, the type of \(k\) is not necessarily set indefinitely.

In these cases, the type of \(k\) might switch, depending on the types of his friends. This is a sociological process known as conformation and plays a major role in the everyday behaviour of people.\\

This gives rise to a new modification of the model.
For any person \(k\), before moving to a new location, \(k\) has a catagorical probability with to switch to a different type, where 
\[\mathbb{P}(\text{NewType}(k)=t) = \begin{cases} 
 \frac{\#\text{Neighbours of type }t}{\text{Total number of neighbours}}	&\mbox{if } \text{total number of neighbours}>0 \\ 
\mathbbm{1}_{\{t=\text{Type}(k)\}}   &\mbox{if } \text{total number of neighbours}=0
\end{cases}\]
Note that this is well defined, since for total number of neighbours \(> 0\), we have \( \mathbb{P}(\text{NewType}(k)=t) \geq 0\) and \(\sum_{i=0}^{\text{types}}\mathbb{P}(\text{NewType}(k)=t)=1\). An example of how this may effect the equilibrium, is illustrated below:

    \label{fig:wissel 12}
\end{figure}

A crucial difference between equilibrium with and without switching, is that if switching is allowed, the concentration of the types may differ between the starting board and the equilibrium status. 
This can be seen in figure \ref{fig:wissel 12} as the number of people of the green type decreased from 10 to 8, the yellow type even decreased from 10 to 6. 
As a matter of fact, allowing switching might lead to the extinction of several types. 

This is not generally the case for lower bounds on the happiness rule, but if the happiness rule is increased, several types might cease to exist. Despite this being quite interesting, the extinction of types is not included in this report.
What will be studied in this report, is the effect of switching, on the given research questions. In other words, how will the results discussed in this report, vary when switching is allowed.

\subsection{Average number of generations until equilibrium}
The first graph to be discussed, will be the effect of switching on the average number of generations until equilibrium. 
From figure \ref{fig:avegen}, we deduced that on average, a board reaches equilibrium in only a few generations. This however decreases even more drastically when switching goes in effect:

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
    \begin{subfigure}{0.9\textwidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{happinessrule-totaantgenwithswitchorwithoutswitch}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Number of generations until equilibrium on an 8x8 bord with standard setting, with and without type switching}
    \label{fig:AantGenS}
\end{figure}

In figure \ref{fig:AantGenS}, we see a comparison of the average number of generations for with and without type switching. 
There is a clear difference that when type switching is applied, it takes much less generations to reach the equilibrium. 
This is expected, since the probability of becoming the same type as the neighbours is more favored in our model, which results in a increase of happiness. 
Or, in a sociological view, the person is willing to adapt to the enviroment rather than moving on.\\

From figure \ref{fig:AantGenS}, we observed that the average generations is nearly constant for any HR in the interval \((0.6,1)\). 
Just to get an idea whether this statement is justified, we selected only three HR's, namely 0.6, 0.8 and 1 and performed the two sample t-test(ttest2) in Matlab. 
This t-test tests the null-hypothesis $H_0:\mu=\nu$ with $\mu,\nu$ respectively the mean of the distribution of $X$ and $Y$, against $H_1:\mu\neq\nu$. It uses the test statistics:
 \[T=\frac{\overline{X}-\overline{Y}}{\sqrt{\frac{S^2_X}{m}-\frac{S^2_Y}{n}}}\]
This test assumes that the mean difference $\mu-\nu$ is normally distributed, and since our data are from the discrete random variables, this assumption would not make sense. 
However, according to the central limit theorems, we may make this assumption for large enough sample size. 
To avoid difficult calculations of how big the sample size is needed, we simply chose a size of 50000. 
Also, in our case, we made sure $m=n$, and the test can also be adjusted to not assume equal variance.\\

After the simulations, we obtained the following sample means:
\begin{table}[htp]
\centering
\caption{Sample means of number of generations simulated with HR 0.6, 0.8 and 1, with 50000 sample size for each HR.}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
 HR&0.6&0.8&1 \\ \hline
 Sample Mean&2.5213&2.5616&2.5711  \\ \hline 
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
We applied the t-test twice. 
First time comparing the mean of HR 0.6 and 0.8. 
Second time for comparing the mean of 0.8 and 1. 
The first test rejected the null-hypothesis, the second did not. 
So with 95\% confidence level, we may conclude that the average generations are unequal for HR 0.6 vs 0.8, but equal for HR 0.8 vs 1.\\

Just like in section 4, in order to get an idea about the distribution of the random variable of $Y_{j,s}$(referring to the notation in section 4, with s meaning type switching), we plotted again histograms for HR 1/4, 1/3, 1/2 and 1. This is shown in figure \ref{fig:histogramSw}.

    \caption{The probability distribution of $Y$ (the number of generations until reaching the equilibrium) is approximated with a histogram of bin size 1.

    \label{fig:histogramSw}
\end{figure}
Again, all $Y_{s,j}$'s appears to be following the same distribution just as without switch(section 4). The histograms suggest that the $Y_{j,s}$'s might follow a geometrical distribution, which is a Negative Binomial with $r=1$. But we could not perform the same statistical analysis as in section 4, because the maximum likelihood estimators for the Negative Binomial could not be calculated through the fitdist or other functions. This is due to the fact that the sample means exceeded the sample variance. So from this we could conclude that $Y_{j,s}$'s cannot be geometrically(or NB) distributed.\\
\\
It is much more interesting to compare the distribution of $Y_{j,s}$ with $Y_{j}$. A remarkable observation is that the histograms of $Y_{j,s}$ completely lost it's symmetry compared to the histograms of $Y_j$. Apparently, type switching stimulates segregation so well that it only takes 1 generation to reach equilibrium(remark: we always start with 1 generation, so the fastest segregation is reached at the 2nd generation). To further examine how type swithcing affects generations until equilirbium, we chose to compare $Y_{1,s}$ with $Y_1$ in a QQ-plot:
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}{0.8\textwidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{QQplotY1sw.pdf}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{QQ-plot of $Y_{1,s}$ vs $Y_1$}
    \label{fig:QQplotSw}
\end{figure}  
We see from figure \ref{fig:QQplotSw} that starting from quantile 3 of $Y_1$, the line is flat. This is expected because the most quantile of $Y_{1,s}$ is concentrated on 2. After the flat line we see a linear pattern, which suggests that the 'tail' part of $Y_{1,s}$ and $Y_1$ are not too differently distributed. This can be also observed in the histograms.
