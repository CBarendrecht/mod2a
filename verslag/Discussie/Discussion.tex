\subsection{Average number of generations with and without type switching}
As mentioned in the result, we could not find a proper fit for the distribution of $Y_{j}$ and $Y_{j,s}$, since it does not follow any standard discrete distribution like poisson, binomial, geometric etc. We doubt that the distributions of $Y_j$ or $Y_{j,s}$ are ever recorded in the literature. But we think that the histograms provide a good picture of the distributions. A remarkable observation we had is that the histograms, which can be defined as a random variable $h_n(x)=\frac{1}{n}\sum^n_{i=1}\mathbbm{1}_{a_{j-1}<x\leq a_j}$, for $x\in (a_{j-1},a_j]$($x$ a realisation of an random variable),  did not appear very random. What we mean here, is that when we plotted the histograms of several samples from the same $Y_j$, they are always nearly identical, which is not expected from a random variable. Although we didn't confirm this observation with a statistical test, this does indicates that $Y_j$ has a very peculiar distribution.\\
\\
Another remark about the histograms, is that unfortunately, there is a small convention error for the number of generations(an error that we found out too late). Our model counts the number of generations always starting from 1, thus equilibrium can never be reached at the first generation by definition. This convention is actually confusing because the counter would give 2 if 1 generation has passed. But this error does not seem to affect the histogram more than just a shift of the location of the mean.\\
